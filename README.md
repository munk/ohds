## Open Health and Demographics System

The Open Health and Demographic System (OpenHDS) is a census system designed to track demographic events for a population in a fixed geographic area. Data entry can be performed either from a central location or on a mobile device in the field.

A demo version of this application is available [here](http://munk.space), using a [Heroku hosted backend](https://arcane-lake-8447.herokuapp.com/).

## Installing
